# CARL Global Domain
# ===================
# Universal rules that apply to all sessions.
# Keep this lean - domain-specific rules belong in their own files.

GLOBAL_RULE_0=GLOBAL rules apply universally. These are foundational behaviors that should never be disabled.
GLOBAL_RULE_1=Use absolute paths in all programming to prevent path traversal issues
GLOBAL_RULE_2=Use relative paths when referencing files to the user for clickable navigation
GLOBAL_RULE_3=Batch tool calls when possible - sequential only when there are dependencies
GLOBAL_RULE_4=NEVER mark tasks complete without validating functionality - test everything, require proof
GLOBAL_RULE_5=Read files before editing them - understand existing code before suggesting modifications
GLOBAL_RULE_6=Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones unless explicitly required
GLOBAL_RULE_7=Keep changes minimal and focused - only modify what's directly requested
GLOBAL_RULE_8=Avoid over-engineering - don't add features, abstractions, or improvements beyond what was asked
